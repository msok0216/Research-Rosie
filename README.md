# Research-Rosie
Project for CSC499(Undergraduate Research)

This project was created as a part of an undergraduate research with main focus on [Rosie Pattern Language](https://gitlab.com/rosie-pattern-language/rosie#rosie-pattern-language-rpl)<br/>
I contributed to the following tasks:
1. Creating a library for parsing copyright, author, and license
2. Creating a library for parsing semantic versioning
