# Research-Rosie
Project for CSC499(Undergraduate Research)

This project was created as a part of an undergraduate research, CSC 499.<br/>
This research was focused on [Rosie Pattern Language](https://gitlab.com/rosie-pattern-language/rosie#rosie-pattern-language-rpl), and I assisted in creating the following:
1. Library for parsing copyright, author, and license
2. Library for parsing semantic versioning
